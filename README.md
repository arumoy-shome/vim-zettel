# vim-zettel

This is a vim package for managing notes using the Zettelkasten method in (neo)vim.

## Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten which is German for "slip-box" is a method for managing notes, first proposed by the German sociologist Nichlas Luhmann. If you don't already know how it works, I recommend the excellent book [How to take smart notes][book] by Sonke Ahrens. Alternatively, free information and resources can be found at [Zettelkasten.de][web].

## Usage

Please note that this package is meant for my personal use only and is not ready for distribution. I simply wanted to extract this bit of functionality into a package although in future, this may be ready for others to use. Meanwhile, the project is open sourced so feel free to use it as reference for your own vim packages.
